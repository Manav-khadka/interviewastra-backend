# Resume Section Ordering Guide

## Overview
You can now control the order of sections in your resume by including a `section_order` array in your `content_json`.

## Default Section Order
If you don't specify `section_order`, sections appear in this default order:
1. Education
2. Experience
3. Projects
4. Technical Skills
5. Certifications (if present)
6. Leadership (if present)

## Custom Section Ordering

### Example 1: Experience First (Most Common for Professionals)
```json
{
  "title": "Senior Software Engineer Resume",
  "template_id": 1,
  "content_json": {
    "section_order": ["experience", "skills", "projects", "education", "certifications", "leadership"],
    "heading": { ... },
    "experience": [ ... ],
    "skills": { ... },
    "projects": [ ... ],
    "education": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Skills First (Good for Career Changers)
```json
{
  "section_order": ["skills", "projects", "experience", "education"],
  ...
}
```

### Example 3: Projects First (Good for Students/Bootcamp Grads)
```json
{
  "section_order": ["education", "projects", "skills", "experience"],
  ...
}
```

### Example 4: Education First (Good for Recent Graduates)
```json
{
  "section_order": ["education", "skills", "projects", "experience", "leadership"],
  ...
}
```

## Available Section Names
- `"education"` - Education Section
- `"experience"` - Work Experience Section
- `"projects"` - Projects Section
- `"skills"` - Technical Skills Section
- `"certifications"` - Certifications Section (optional)
- `"leadership"` - Leadership/Extracurricular Section (optional)

## Important Notes

1. **Order Matters**: The sections will appear in the exact order you specify in the array
2. **Skip Sections**: Only include section names you want to appear. Omitted sections won't be rendered
3. **Empty Sections**: Empty sections are automatically skipped even if listed in `section_order`
4. **Heading Always First**: The heading (name, contact info) always appears first, regardless of `section_order`
